# Runtime Value Visualizations

A tool that provides visualizations for different data types in Squeak/Smalltalk. All visualizations are made to work in the context of a watch in a method. For further background information, please have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/hpi-swa-teaching/live21-value-visualization/wiki).

## Installation (tbd)

## Current State

This project is based on two main components:

- Watches with different visualizations that can be switched at runtime without losing the data
- A tool to display the data of all watches that are in the world next to each other in order to allow correlations to be detected
